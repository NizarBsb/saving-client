# saving-client

Spring Boot restTemplate client to fetch all transactions from Starling Bank API, calculate the round-up and save the amount into a new savings goal.


## How is it working?

1) Spring boot will start a new local server and ask the Main method to automatically fetch all transactions.

2) TransactionsResponseInterceptor will capture the response from the API and call the RoundUp method.

3) RoundUpController calculate roundUp of all transactions amounts and create a new savings goal with generated savingGoalUid.

4) SavingGoalResponseInterceptor will capture the savingGoalUid and store the amount using the API.
