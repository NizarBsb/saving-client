# saving-client

Spring Boot restTemplate client to fetch all transactions from Starling Bank API, calculate the round-up and save the amount into a new savings goal.


## How is it working?

1) Spring boot will start a new local server and ask the Main method to automatically fetch all transactions.

2) An interceptor will capture the response from the API and call the RoundUp method.

3) RoundUpController will inject the service to create a new savings goal and finally save it using the API.
